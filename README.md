# Vegan recipe app

This is a simple recipe app for vegan recipes, using Vue3 + Vite and showcasing some basic Vue3/Javascript skills.
If a non vegan ingredient is added, a modal will be shown asking the user to try again.
The app is not connected to any backend server, so the recipes will not be stored.
